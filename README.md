# pacmen exercise
Factory for making pacmen.
When button "make one" is pressed a pacman is added to the array of pacmen, which keeps track of the position and velocity of each pacman.
Each pacman will bounce off any wall it hits using edge detection.

To run, open index.html in a web browser.

Roadmap: Implement hit detection between pacmen.
